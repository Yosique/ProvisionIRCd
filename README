An IRCd written in Python 3.

Not to be confused with the deprecated mSL version I wrote years ago.

Edit conf/ircd.example.conf and save it as conf/ircd.conf.
After you editted the confs, simply run ircd.py.


For anyone interested, there is a live version running on irc.provisionweb.org. (port 6667 plain, 6697 TLS)
You can oper up with /oper github betatest. Keep in mind that the server may be off-line at any time.
It is merely a dev/test server meant as a testing environment and the occasional playground.
